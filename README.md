# Employee Card Generator 
### ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen.svg)

### A command line application that allows a user to enter their team informarmation - seperated into three categories. Manager, Engineer, and Intern. Depending on which type of employee they would like to add the application will prompt for different user inputs.
### I opted to give users the ability to add more than one manager if wanted / required. Upon loading the application the first prompts are for Manager, after that a user can choose to add another Manager, or an Intern, or Engineer.
